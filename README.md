## üìå Project Description

The goal of this project was to design and simulate a **moving conveyor station** integrated with an ABB robot. The station is responsible for **transporting products via the conveyor**, detecting the product position, and then sending a **GO signal** to the robot, which is tasked with **picking up the product and placing it in the designated location**.

The project was developed using **ABB RobotStudio**, a dedicated software environment that allows for advanced robotic simulations without the need for physical hardware.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies and Tools

- **ABB RobotStudio** ‚Äì primary simulation environment
- **Smart Components** ‚Äì used for modeling the moving conveyor and signal handling
- **RAPID** ‚Äì ABB‚Äôs programming language for robot control
- **I/O Signals** ‚Äì for communication between the conveyor and robot

## üß© Features

- Dynamic **moving conveyor** with speed control
- Generation of a trigger signal to initiate robot product pickup (**GO signal**)
- Robot program for picking up and placing products based on received signals
- Clear project structure enabling easy expansion and scenario testing
- Fully integrated test environment simulating real working conditions


## ‚úÖ Applications

This project can be used as:
- An educational demo for those learning to work with RobotStudio
- A base for creating more advanced automation tasks
- A prototype for testing robot-conveyor integration in a virtual environment
